    "Q1. The difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding lies in the nature of the categorical variable being encoded. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ordinal Encoding: Assigns numerical labels to categories based on their order or rank. This implies that there's a meaningful order among the categories.\n",
    "- Label Encoding: Assigns unique numerical labels to each category without considering any order or rank among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you have a categorical variable \"Education Level\" with categories \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" \"Master's,\" and \"PhD.\" If there's a clear order among these categories, like \"High School\" < \"Bachelor's\" < \"Master's\" < \"PhD,\" you would use Ordinal Encoding. If there's no such order, you would use Label Encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique where categories are encoded based on the target variable's mean or median value for each category. It's useful when you have a categorical variable with a high cardinality (many unique categories) and want to capture the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "In a machine learning project predicting customer churn, you might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to encode customer segments based on their average churn rate. This would create ordinal encoding where categories with higher churn rates get higher numerical labels, capturing the relationship between customer segments and churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. It's important in statistical analysis because it helps understand the relationship between variables. A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance indicates that they move in opposite directions. Covariance is calculated using the formula:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Label encoding assigns a numerical label to each category in each column. For example, in the \"Color\" column, \"red\" is encoded as 2, \"green\" as 1, and \"blue\" as 0.\n",

    "Q5. To calculate the covariance matrix for the variables Age, Income, and Education level, you would compute the pairwise covariances between these variables. The covariance matrix would be a 3x3 matrix where each element (i, j) represents the covariance between variables i and j.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "- Positive covariance between Age and Income would indicate that as age increases, income tends to increase.\n",
    "- Covariance between Age and Education level might indicate how education level and age relate to each other, but interpretation would depend on the context and specific dataset.\n",

    "Interpretation:\n",
    "- Positive covariance between Temperature and Humidity indicates that as temperature increases, humidity tends to increase.\n",
